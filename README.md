# Name-Generator
Model that using recurrent neural network ( character-level) for generation names. 

things that i have done:
- store text data for processing using an RNN
- synthesize data, by sampling predictions at each time step and passing it to the next RNN-cell unit
- build a character-level text generation recurrent neural network
- clipping gradients
